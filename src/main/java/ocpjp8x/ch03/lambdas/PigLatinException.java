//    Lambda functions can refer to local variables from the enclosing scope. The variable needs to be explicitly declared
//final or that variable will be treated as effectively final.

//    Note that this restriction does not apply to data members and class members. Hence you may be at risk when multiple
// threads concurrently modify variables within a lambda expression. Further, effectively final applies only to the references
// and not to the values pointed by the references. Hence, you can mutate the values inside a local array from a lambda functionâ€”it is unsafe but possible
