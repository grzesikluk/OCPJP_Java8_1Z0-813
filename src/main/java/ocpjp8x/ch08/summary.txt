Summary
Let’s briefly review the key points from each certification objective in this chapter. Please read it before appearing for the exam.
Create and manage date-based and time-based events including a combination of date and time into a single object using LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, Instant, Period, and Duration
The Java 8 date and time API uses ISO 8601 as the default calendar format.
The java.time.LocalDate class represents a date without time or time zones; the java.time.LocalTime class represents time without dates and time zones; the java.time.LocalDateTime class represents both date and time without time zones.
The java.time.Instant class represents a Unix timestamp.
The java.time.Period is used to measure the amount of time in terms of years, months, and days.
The java.time.Duration class represents time in terms of hours, minutes, seconds, and fraction of seconds.
Work with dates and times across timezones and manage changes resulting from daylight savings including Format date and times values
ZoneId identifies a time zone; ZoneOffset represents time zone offset from UTC/Greenwich.
ZonedDateTime provides support for all three aspects: date, time, and time zone.
You have to account for daylight savings time (DST) when working with different time zones.
The java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter class provides support for reading or printing date and time values in different formats.
The DateTimeFormatter class provides predefined constants (such as ISO_DATE and ISO_TIME) for formatting date and time values.
You encode the format of the date or time using case-sensitive letters to form a date or time pattern string with the DateTimeFormatter class.
Define and create and manage date-based and time-based events using Instant, Period, Duration, and TemporalUnit
The enumeration java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit implements the java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit interface.
Both TemporalUnit and ChronoUnit deal with time unit values such as seconds, minutes, and hours and date values such as days, months, and years.
